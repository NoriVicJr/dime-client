-    I committed some minor changes in context-model on a couple of fields names in ContextItem and ContextSource to be aligned to DAO on the PS

-    The payload sent to the PS has a “message” field in the “meta” part. I suppose it is the same for every other payload posted. But the Meta object on the PS is expecting a “msg” field instead, so I got a Bad Request error every time I post new context. Which is the correct one?

-    HTTP POST request to post new context data currently invokes this url: 

https://<PS_HOST>:8080/dime/<said>/context/@me/ 

but PS exposes APIs like:

https://<PS_HOST>:8080/dime-communications/api/dime/rest/<said>/context/@me

Which is the correct one? (I copied also Rafa for this)



I updated the wiki page and added a descriptions of the steps for enrollment, to be further discussed tomorrow. You can find them here:  https://confluence.deri.ie:8443/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=45842478#2012-06-11TelkodimeDNS%26proxylayer-4Enrollmentprocess


Regarding hosting of the DNS and registry, we can take care of that at bdigital. We'll provide a temporary VM, which will need to be changed after the event in Segovia (probably to another bdigital machine), and will open 1 or 2 ports as required.  


@Simon, for access to the PS, a client would need to query the DNS specifying the SAid, and in return it'll receive an IP address, so no changes to what has been discussed so far.
