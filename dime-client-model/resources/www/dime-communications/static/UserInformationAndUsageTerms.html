<p>
    Thank you very much for trying out the di.me system on the <em>IV Curso de Verano AMETIC-UPM</em>! With this user study, we evaluate a first working
    prototype of our research project. The study aims to approve the system&#8217;s performance, usability, and acceptance by end-users.
</p>
<p>
    For us it is of high value that you try out this prototype and give us your feedback!
</p>
<p>
    Who we are: the di.me European research project led by Fraunhofer
</p>
<p>
    The di.me project is a research project developing a new technology for personal information management, funded by the European Union (FP7/2007- 2013,
    n&#176; 257787). The project is led by Fraunhofer Gesellschaft f&#252;r angewandte Forschung, a major German non-profit research organization. Fraunhofer,
    AMETIC, University of Siegen, and five other public research institutions and private companies (see www.dime-project.eu) are partners of the di.me project
    (henceforth &#8220;the di.me consortium&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221;).
</p>
<p>
    The di.me system: a research prototype for advanced, privacy-ensuring social communication
</p>
<p>
    The di.me system that we ask you to try out is a working prototype for a system organizing advanced, privacy-ensuring social communication. It is
    specifically set up for the <em>IV Curso de Verano AMETIC-UPM</em>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The following components of the <em>di.me system</em> consists of the following technical components:
</p>
<p>
    1) a <em>personal server</em> for each user. The personal server of one user is technically separated from the personal servers of other users. The
    personal servers run on web servers provided by the University of Siegen as partner of the di.me consortium.
</p>
<p>
    2) the <em>Android application (client)</em> that you have installed on your smartphone connects to your personal server.
</p>
<p>
    3) the <em>di.me services</em> that are called to perform functions that cannot be executed on your personal server. These services run on web servers
    provided by the partners of the di.me consortium.
</p>
<p>
    Your privacy
</p>
<p>
    The di.me system stores personal data to realize the functionalities of the system and scientific analysis of anonymised log files. Data will not be used
    for other than the designated purpose, in particular not for any commercial purpose.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Where are the data stored?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    All data entered or collected in di.me are stored on your <em>personal server</em>. Data in the <em>Android application</em> are transmitted to your
    personal server. The <em>di.me services</em> use anonymised data for specific functions: if you use rate the &#8220;places&#8221; a voting function in
    di.me to get personalized POI recommendations, your anonymised ratings are transferred. If you activate the function &#8220;share my location&#8221; on
    your Android phone, your location information from the Android phone is used for
</p>
<p>
    to automatically detect and suggest to you at which place and situation you currently are, and what groups of people are nearby. Your current place, and
    situations are shown only to you. The groups of people nearby are shown to all people using the location sharing. All automatic suggestions are calculated
    on a di.me server that gets only your location information and a pseudonym.
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Which data are stored?</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    The following data are used by the system:
</p>
<p>
    1) the information you enter or upload to the system, including files or photos that you upload to the system
</p>
<p>
    2) if you have agreed to that when registering to <em>IV Curso de Verano AMETIC-UPM: </em>information from the registration web page
</p>
<p>
    3) if you connect di.me to external systems (e.g. LinkedIn or Twitter), data from there are copied to the di.me system
</p>
<p>
    4) if you activate the function &#8220;share my location&#8221; on your Android phone: anonymized location data from your mobile phone
</p>
<p>
    5) for scientific, anonymised analysis: information on what you do with the system (log files); see below
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Deletion of data after four weeks</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    We will delete all personal data after four weeks when we delete the di.me system used for the <em>IV Curso De Verano AMETIC-UPM, but will retain </em>
    anonymised log files for scientific analysis (see below.<em>)</em>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Anonymized log files for scientific analysis</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    For our project, it is important to analyse how the system is used in order to optimize it. For that, log files are stored that we want to analyse for user
actions.    <em>For our analysis, we will generate a anonymised version of these log files. All data that can be traced back to your identity will be deleted </em>
    (like: name, company name, field of study, email address, any di.me user-names or passwords, personal documents, photos, etc.).
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em> </em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong><em>Cases of violation of user responsibilities or criminal offenses</em></strong>
</p>
<p>
    Substantiated, suspected cases of gross violation of user responsibilities or of criminal offenses committed in connection with the use of the di.me system
    are excluded from the above regulations. In these cases, the di.me consortium partners are entitled to investigate according to local legislation and to
    transmit personal data to third parties within the limits of the statutory provisions, e.g. if ordered to do so by a judge or public prosecutor.
</p>
<p>
    No liability for end-users content, no warranty against defects for the test prototype,
</p>
<p>
    The di.me consortium is not liable for any information entered or linked by the users of the di.me system, e.g. content uploaded, entered, or shared
    through the system, or links to external web information. The di.me consortium works with state-of-the-art technologies and methods to ensure the proper
function and security of the provided research prototype. However, the system is intended only to be used as test system that you can try out during the    <em>IV Curso de Verano AMETIC-UPM</em>. So, we unfortunately cannot give any warranty for the availability or accessibility of the system and it&#8217;s
    contained data, or for the technical maturity of the prototype.
</p>
<p>
    User Responsibilities
</p>
<p>
    When using the di.me system, you agree to demonstrate a sense of responsibility. In particular, this means:
</p>
<p>
    - respecting the rules of privacy and confidentiality prescribed by the law
</p>
<p>
    - making no unauthorized access to data, or the IT infrastructure
</p>
<p>
    - taking care to protect personal and sensitive data and avoid infringement of intellectual property
</p>
<p>
    rights or other personal rights of any other user or third parties.
</p>
<p>
    It is strictly forbidden to make deliberate or knowing use of the provided di.me system for purposes that are likely to compromise the security of the IT
    infrastructure, or contravene the law. It is furthermore forbidden to distribute content of violating the prevailing laws on the confidentiality of
    personal data, intellectual property rights, or criminal offences, publish statements or images of an insulting, slanderous, anti-constitutional, racist,
    sexist, violent, or pornographic nature.
</p>
<p>
